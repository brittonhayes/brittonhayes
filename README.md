# Hi, I'm Britton

I build tools. Some polished, others exploratory. All shared openly because I believe in sharing every step of the learning process.

You'll find everything here - from my first college coding projects to production open source services I maintain to weekend explorations. The quality varies, but the intent remains: solve problems and share solutions.

If something here helps you solve a problem, I'd like to know. And if you're working on something interesting, I'd like to hear about that too.
