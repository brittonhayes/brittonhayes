### Hi, I'm Britton

I build tools. Some polished, others exploratory. All shared openly because I believe in sharing every step of the learning process.

You'll find everything here from my first html to production open source services I maintain to weekend explorations. The quality varies, but the intent remains: solve problems and share solutions.

If something here helps you solve a problem or you have an idea, I'd probably love to hear your thoughts.
